    <h1>What I'm demonstrating</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>E-books can work offline</strong>
        - important for flights, holidays, trains etc
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No server trickery needed</strong>
        - both publications and reader can be hosted statically
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Speed &amp; simplicity</strong>
        - no heavy framework or render-blocking JavaScript in
        the way of content.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>It's just the web</strong>
        - publications are just html, so can use css, images, video,
        audio, svg… anything the web can use. However, script
        is blocked in the e-book reader, as running arbitrary
        script would be risky.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Links</strong>
        - Linking &amp; navigation works as expected, even
        within imported e-books provided two users have added
        the same e-book to the reader. Bookmarks can be used
        as, well, bookmarks. Fancy that.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Archive obfuscation</strong>
        - The archive has an empty byte added to the start
        so it can't be read in a regular unarchiver. I don't
        personally care for this, but if this is what publishers
        want, it is possible. I guess it worked for WOFF.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What I'm not demonstrating</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>UI design</strong>
        - I mean… I just can't.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Best-practice maintainable code</strong>
        - I hacked it together on a plane for fun.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How service workers are used</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Request interception and caching</strong>
        - makes the whole thing work offline and produces
        urls and normal navigation patterns in the e-book
        reader.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Archive building on the fly</strong>
        - once streams land, the archive format can be generated
        and read in a more memory efficient way. Although the
        archive could be generated by a build system, the client
        side build allows dynamic building of the archive based
        on user options.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Publication format</h1>
    <p>
      They're just web pages, but with the following requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Relative URLs</strong>
        - so they can be opened anywhere.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="../pub-manifest.json">A manifest file</a></strong>
        - with the name of the book and the urls it requires.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>That's it!</p>
