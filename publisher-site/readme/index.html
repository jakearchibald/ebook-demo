    <h1>What's going on?</h1>
    <p>
      I attended a meeting of the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/wiki/Main_Page">
        Digital Publishing Interest Group
      </a> 
      recently to provide info on service workers and how
      they may benefit web implementations of ebook readers.
      As far as I gathered, the requirements were:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Works offline</li>
      <li>May be hosted</li>
      <li>May be a single file that can be downloaded and shared</li>
      <li>The single file shouldn't be unzippable by the OS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Well, I had a 13 hour flight, so I decided to do some hacking,
      and this is it.

    <h1>How to use it</h1>
    <p>
      You're reading one of the publications right now. It's just
      regular static HTML with a single non-blocking script include.
      This would be under the control of a publisher, perhaps behind
      a login system. <a href="../">View the "publisher"'s homepage</a>
      for other publications.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your browser supports service workers (such as Google Chrome),
      you'll see a checkbox at the top of this page to make the
      publication work offline, and a link to download an archived
      format of the publication.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a seperate <a href="../../reader-site/">e-book reader site</a>
      which allows you to view the single-file publication archives.
      In reality it would sit on a different origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browsers that don't support service worker can still view
      publications, but they don't work offline &amp; can't be downloaded
      as an archive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="../../reader-site/">e-book reader site</a> requires
      a service worker capable browser.
    </p>

      and how the service worker was used.
